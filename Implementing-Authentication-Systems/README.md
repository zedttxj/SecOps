## Implementing SSO on the Internet
Imagine you want to transfer money from Bank A to Bank B. You could give Bank B your credentails to Bank A and have them transfer the money. Sound scary? You bet. You should never be required to give your credentials to any third party. Solutions such as SAML, OAuth, OpenID, and OIDC help solve this problem. They share authentication, authorization, or profile information about a user, and some solutions share all three.

Databases from multiple vendors can import and export data to and from an XML format, making XML a common language used to exchange information if companies agree on what schema to use. Many cloud-based providers use XML-based languages to share information for authentication and authorization. They donâ€™t use XML as it is but instead use other languages based on XML.
