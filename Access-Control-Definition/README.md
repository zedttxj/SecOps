1. Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
ï‚·The owner of a resource (file, database, etc.) decides who gets access.
ï‚·Example: In Windows, if you create a file, you can set permissions for other users.
ï‚·Downside: Not very secureâ€”users can grant access freely.
2. Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
ï‚·Access is controlled by system-enforced policies (not the user).
ï‚·Common in military and government systems where security classifications matter.
ï‚·Example: Top Secret documents can only be accessed by people with Top Secret clearance.
3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
ï‚·Users are assigned roles, and roles have permissions.
ï‚·Example: 
oAdmins can access everything.
oManagers can approve requests but not change system settings.
oEmployees can only view their own data.
ï‚·Common in corporate IT systems.
4. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
ï‚·Access is granted based on attributes (user, resource, environment).
ï‚·More flexible than RBAC because it doesnâ€™t rely on fixed roles.
ï‚·Example: 
o"Doctors can view patient records only during work hours."
o"Employees can access the system only from company devices."
5. Rule-Based Access Control
ï‚·Uses if-then rules to grant/deny access.
ï‚·Example: 
o"Block all employees from logging in after 10 PM."
o"Allow only encrypted devices to access the network."
ï‚·Often used with other models like RBAC or ABAC.
6. Risk-Based Access Control (RBAC, but different from the role-based one)
ï‚·Access depends on a risk score calculated in real-time.
ï‚·Example: 
oIf a user logs in from an unusual location, require extra authentication.
oIf a device is outdated or unpatched, limit its access.
ï‚·Used in zero-trust security and fraud prevention.
7. Identity-Based Access Control (IBAC)
ï‚·Grants access based on a specific userâ€™s identity rather than their role.
ï‚·Example: A CEO might have unique permissions that no other employees have.
8. Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)
ï‚·Uses a set of policies to define who can do what.
ï‚·Example: Cloud providers like AWS use PBAC to let organizations define custom rules for access.
Final Thoughts
ï‚·If flexibility is needed â†’ ABAC is the best choice.
ï‚·If strict rules are needed â†’ MAC is best.
ï‚·If simplicity & structure are important â†’ RBAC works well.
ï‚·If dynamic decisions are required â†’ Risk-Based Access Control helps.
ACL in Networking (Router, Firewall)
ï‚·Used to control network traffic by defining rules for which packets can pass or be blocked.
ï‚·Commonly found in routers, firewalls, and switches.
ï‚·Rules are based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
âœ… Example (Cisco Router ACL):
plaintext
Copy code
access-list 101 permit tcp any host 192.168.1.10 eq 22
access-list 101 deny ip any any
ðŸ”¹ This allows SSH (port 22) traffic to 192.168.1.10 but blocks everything else.

2. ACL in File Systems / OS Security
ï‚·Used to restrict access to files and directories.
ï‚·Defines which users or groups can read, write, or execute files.
ï‚·Found in Windows NTFS, Linux, and Unix systems.
âœ… Example (Linux ACL using setfacl):
bash
Copy code
setfacl -m u:john:r-- file.txt
ðŸ”¹ This grants read-only access to John for file.txt.
âœ… Example (Windows NTFS ACL using PowerShell):
powershell
Copy code
icacls C:\example.txt /grant John:(R)
ðŸ”¹ This grants read-only access to John for example.txt.

Key Differences
Feature	Network ACL (Router/Firewall)	File System ACL (OS Security)
Purpose	Controls network traffic	Controls file access
Applies To	IP addresses, ports, protocols	Users, groups, and file permissions
Common Use	Firewalls, routers, switches	Linux, Windows, Unix
Example	access-list 101 deny ip any any	icacls C:\file /grant John:(R)
